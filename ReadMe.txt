This project consists of 2 parts.

 The first part provides an example of how to price a special type of Option (Barrier option), particularly Knock-out option (the option ceases to exist when the underlying asset reaches the barrier level).This code based on J.C.Hull, "Options, future, and other derivatives", 9th edition, Pearson, 2017.

The second part concerns pricing option with implicit and explicit finite difference methods. The idea behind these methods is that we can price a derivative by solving the differential equation that the derivative satisfies. It is also based on J.C.Hull, "Options, future, and other derivatives", 9th edition, Pearson, 2017.
